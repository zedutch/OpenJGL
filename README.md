## About OpenJGL
I mainly created OpenJGl to use for the [Ludum Dare](http://ludumdare.com/compo/) Compo. Therefore, OpenJGL mainly focuses on quick prototyping and a little less on making fully fleshed out games. I might extend this in the future, though.

I am planning on using and extending OpenJGL during Ludum Dare 34, which will run from December 12th until December 14th (CET).

OpenJGL was created entirely by [Robin Arys](http://www.zedutchgandalf.be).
